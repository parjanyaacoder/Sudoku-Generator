# Sudoku-Generator
My this code generate a Sudoku and fill few elements depending on the difficulty level.
If you choose difficulty level as easy it will fill 10-15 elements,medium it will fill 5-10 elements and for hard it will fill 5 elements.
The rest elements marked with 0 and left for you to fill.
Happy Coding
